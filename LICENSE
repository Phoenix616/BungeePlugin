   Copyright is dead.  Copyright remains dead, and we have killed it.  How
   shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?  What was
   holiest and mightiest of all that the world of censorship has yet owned has
   bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us?  What
   water is there for us to clean ourselves?  What festivals of atonement,
   what sacred games shall we have to invent?  Is not the greatness of this
   deed too great for us?  Must we ourselves not become authors simply to
   appear worthy of it?
                                    - apologies to Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche
